# IBM Ponder This - November 2024

## Description
This project contains the solution for the IBM Ponder This challenge for November 2024. The challenge involves finding a tetrahedron with integer sides satisfying a given target volume.

The main computation is performed in the `parallel_compute.py` module. 

In the `compare_det_cal` function, we compare several ways to compute determinants to evaluate their performance and accuracy.
